**NOTES**: 

The csv files at ./data/source/county_demographics/ are a split of the .txt file https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/yr1990_2022.19ages/us.1990_2022.19ages.adjusted.txt.gz. The script that slices the dataset can be found in the auxiliary repository https://github.com/guillelozabala/lmos_opioids_aux. Similarly, the files at ./data/source/labor_market_outcomes/ are a split of https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/la/la.data.64.County.

The sector composition of the counties is obtained from https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/data/datasets.html. The data on the rollout of the PDMPs come from Horwitz et al. (2020)
